# cypress-testing

In order to run these tests, you may have to request an invite off myself (Greg Dorward), as the tool is in Private Beta currently.

Once you have the desktop runner, running the tests is simple, just click into the test folder you wish to run and run all tests. There is a Red Badger folder, along with a couple of other projects that demonstrate the types of commands available.

To run tests from the command line, first run the following command:

'npm install -g cypress-cli'

Install the latest version:

'cypress install'

To update (when necessary)

'cypress update'

To run tests from your current path:

'cypress run'
